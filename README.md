# SLChart.js<br>
The purpose of this file is to take a StrongLifts backup file (a .csv generated by the StrongLifts App) and generate a chart using ChartNew.js.<br>
# Notes<br>
You will have to use style.css if you want a legend with colour indicators<br>
Bootstrap included (not required), but highly recommended<br>
<br>
# Demo
[My SLChart](http://zachtoogood.com/files/SLChart/index.html)<br>
# Dependancies<br>

papaparse.js (http://papaparse.com/)<br>
# Config<br>
There is a configuration object inside SLChart.js, set which fields you want to show and the chart options you want. Theres also an auto-scale option if you don't want to customise the chart too much.
